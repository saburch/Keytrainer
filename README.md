# Keytrainer by wholl0p
## Simple CLI-based App to train and test your keyboard skills

* start the App by typing: `python3 keytrainer.py [level 1-5] [num of iterations]  -f (optional)`
* the higher the level the shorter the legal time slice for your key press
* you can specify a file in the src/ directory called "CONFIG.txt" with a single line string of your own desired characters
